# GNSS/INS Processing

## About
This repository comprises Jupyter Notebooks presenting the outcomes of my MSc Thesis titled 'Development of a holistic open-source processing pipeline for drone-based hyperspectral line scanning systems'. The main goal was to establish an open-source workflow for the Post-Processing Kinematic (PPK) correction of Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) data. This corrected GNSS data was then integrated with Inertial Navigation System (INS) data using an Extended Kalman Filter (EKF). The ultimate goal was to provide precise positioning (X,Y,Z) and orientation (𝜙,𝜃,𝜓) informations for sensors mounted on Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) (Multi/Hyperspectral cameras...).
